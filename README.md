# Credits
All credits go towards joeleoli & funky - https://github.com/vznxyz/praxi

# Skidder
Vifez - skidded this from funkys praxi nodepends without credit he is fucking skid

I am not held responsible for anything that you do while using this source code, I have simply released this as I no longer use it

# What exactly funky changed?
Basic praxi would depend on both Zoot core & SpigotX, But in this version of praxi funky removed the dependencies to make this source code more usable and easier to fork.

# Enjoy.
